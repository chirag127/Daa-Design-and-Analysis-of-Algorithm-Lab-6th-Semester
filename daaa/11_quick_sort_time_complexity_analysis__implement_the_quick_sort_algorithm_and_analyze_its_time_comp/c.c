Quick Sort Time Complexity Analysis: Implement the quick sort algorithm and analyze its time complexity for varying values of n (number of elements in the array). Plot a graph to show the relationship between the time taken and n.
 Here's a sample implementation of Quick sort in C:

```
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int *a, int *b) {
  int temp = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = temp;
}

int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
  int pivot = arr[high];
  int i = low - 1;

  for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
    if (arr[j] < pivot) {
      i++;
      swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
    }
  }
  swap(&arr[i + 1], &arr[high]);
  return (i + 1);
}

void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
  if (low < high) {
    int pi = partition(arr, low, high);
    quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
    quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
  }
}

int main() {
  int arr[] = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};
  int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

  quickSort(arr, 0, n - 1);

  printf("Sorted array: \n");
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf("%d ", arr[i]);

  return 0;
}
```

The time complexity of Quick sort is O(n log n) on average, but worst-case it can be O(n^2). To analyze the time complexity, you can use the clock function from the time.h library to measure the time taken for sorting the array of different sizes. Plot the results using a graph to show the relationship between the time taken and n.
