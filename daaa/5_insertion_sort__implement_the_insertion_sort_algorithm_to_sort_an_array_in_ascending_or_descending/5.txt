Insertion Sort: Implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending or descending order.
/*
 

- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line is like including a big helper who knows how to read and write things on the computer screen.

- `void insertionSort(int arr[], int n, int ascending)`: This line is like creating a special helper who knows how to sort things in order. It takes an array of numbers, the number of things in the array, and if you want them in ascending or descending order.

- `int i, key, j`: These are like little helpers who help the big helper sort the numbers.

- `for (i = 1; i < n; i++)`: This line is like telling the big helper to start from the second number and go till the end.

- `key = arr[i];`: This line is like telling the little helper to remember the current number.

- `j = i - 1;`: This line is like telling the little helper to remember the number before the current number.

- `while (j >= 0 && (ascending ? arr[j] > key : arr[j] < key))`: This line is like telling the little helper to keep moving the number before the current number to the right until it's either in the right place or there are no more numbers to the left.

- `arr[j + 1] = arr[j];`: This line is like telling the little helper to move the number before the current number one step to the right.

- `j = j - 1;`: This line is like telling the little helper to move to the number before the one before the current number.

- `arr[j + 1] = key;`: This line is like telling the little helper to put the current number in the right place.

- `int arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6};`: This line is like giving the big helper an array of numbers to sort.

- `int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);`: This line is like telling the big helper how many numbers there are in the array.

- `printf("Given array is \n");`: This line is like telling the big helper to write "Given array is" on the screen.

- `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`: This line is like telling the big helper to write each number in the array on the screen.

- `insertionSort(arr, n, 1);`: This line is like telling the special helper to sort the numbers in ascending order.

- `printf("\nSorted array in ascending order is \n");`: This line is like telling the big helper to write "Sorted array in ascending order is" on the screen.

- `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`: This line is like telling the big helper to write each number in the sorted array on the screen.

- `return 0;`: This line is like telling the computer that the program has finished and everything is okay.
