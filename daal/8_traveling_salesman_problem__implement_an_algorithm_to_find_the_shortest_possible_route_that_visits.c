Traveling Salesman Problem: Implement an algorithm to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city.
 Here's a sample code in C for the Traveling Salesman Problem using the nearest neighbor algorithm:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <math.h>

#define MAX_CITIES 100
#define MAX_DISTANCE 1000000000

typedef struct {
  int x;
  int y;
} City;

double distance(City a, City b) {
  int dx = a.x - b.x;
  int dy = a.y - b.y;
  return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

int main() {
  int n;
  City cities[MAX_CITIES];

  scanf("%d", &n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    scanf("%d%d", &cities[i].x, &cities[i].y);
  }

  int path[MAX_CITIES];
  bool visited[MAX_CITIES];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    path[i] = -1;
    visited[i] = false;
  }

  path[0] = 0;
  visited[0] = true;

  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int current = path[i - 1];
    int nearest = -1;
    double min_distance = MAX_DISTANCE;
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (!visited[j]) {
        double d = distance(cities[current], cities[j]);
        if (d < min_distance) {
          min_distance = d;
          nearest = j;
        }
      }
    }
    path[i] = nearest;
    visited[nearest] = true;
  }

  double total_distance = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    total_distance += distance(cities[path[i - 1]], cities[path[i]]);
  }
  total_distance += distance(cities[path[n - 1]], cities[0]);

  printf("Shortest route: ");
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("%d ", path[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");
  printf("Total distance: %lf\n", total_distance);

  return 0;
}
```

/*
 A computer program is being written here to find the shortest route between a set of cities. The first few lines include different libraries to use in the code. The next few lines define some constants and a structure to store the coordinates of a city. Then, a function is defined to calculate the distance between two cities. After that, the number of cities is read from the user and the coordinates of each city are stored in an array. An array is also created to keep track of which cities have been visited and another array to store the order of the cities in the shortest route. The program then uses a nearest neighbor algorithm to find the shortest route between the cities. The total distance of the route is calculated and printed. Finally, the program returns 0 to indicate that it has finished running successfully.
