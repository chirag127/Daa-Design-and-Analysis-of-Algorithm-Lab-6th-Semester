complete the following practical for my wt assignement 

5. Write a Java applet to display the Application Program screen i.e. calculator and other.

1. Create a new Java file in your IDE
2. Import java.awt.* and java.applet.* libraries
3. Extend the Applet class and override the init() and paint() methods
4. In the init() method, create UI elements such as buttons and text fields
5. In the paint() method, use the Graphics object to draw the calculator screen
6. Compile and run the applet in your browser or IDE.
/*
 
1. This line is a general instruction to create a new Java file in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
2. The java.awt.* library provides classes for creating user interfaces and handling events, while the java.applet.* library provides support for creating applets. 
3. The Applet class is a base class for creating applets and the "extend" keyword is used to inherit the properties and methods of the Applet class into your own custom class. The init() and paint() methods are overridden to provide custom functionality.
4. The init() method is called when the applet is first loaded and is used to initialize UI elements such as buttons and text fields.
5. The paint() method is used to draw the calculator screen and is called whenever the applet needs to be repainted. The Graphics object is passed as a parameter and can be used to draw shapes, text, and images on the screen.
6. Finally, the applet is compiled and run in a browser or IDE to display the calculator screen.
