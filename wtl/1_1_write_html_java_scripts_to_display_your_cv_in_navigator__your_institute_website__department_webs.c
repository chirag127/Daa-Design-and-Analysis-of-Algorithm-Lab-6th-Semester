complete the following practical for my wt assignement 

1. Write HTML/Java scripts to display your CV in navigator, your Institute website, Department Website and Tutorial website for specific subject
 To display your CV in a browser, you can write an HTML file with your CV information and use CSS to style it as desired. You can also use JavaScript to add interactivity to your CV, for example, to toggle sections or display additional information. Here is an example of a basic HTML template for a CV:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My CV</title>
    <style>
      /* Add your CSS styles here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Your Name</h1>
      <p>Your Job Title</p>
    </header>
    <main>
      <section>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Degree, Institution</h3>
            <p>Year, Field of Study</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Job Title, Company</h3>
            <p>Year, Description</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Skill 1</li>
          <li>Skill 2</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

To display your CV on a website, you can upload the HTML file to a web server or use a platform like GitHub Pages to host it for free. You can then link to your CV from your Institute, Department, and Tutorial websites.
