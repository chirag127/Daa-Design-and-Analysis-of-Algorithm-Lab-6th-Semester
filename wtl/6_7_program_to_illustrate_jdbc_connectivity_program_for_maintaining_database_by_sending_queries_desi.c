/*


This is a high-level description of the steps involved in connecting to a database using JDBC and SQL.

1. "Create a database in MS Access" - This step involves creating a database in Microsoft Access, which is a relational database management system.

2. "Create an ODBC link to connect to the database" - This step involves creating an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) link, which is a standard API for accessing databases. The ODBC link is used to connect to the MS Access database.

3. "Write Java code to connect to the database using JDBC" - This step involves writing Java code to connect to the database using the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API. The JDBC API provides a standard way to connect to databases and execute SQL statements.

4. "Write SQL queries to maintain the database" - This step involves writing SQL statements to maintain the database. Examples of SQL statements include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

5. "Implement a simple servlet to query the database and display the results" - This step involves writing a simple servlet that queries the database and displays the results. A servlet is a Java program that runs on a server and provides a way to interact with the database.

6. "Compile and run the Java JDBC code" - This step involves compiling the Java code and running it to connect to the database and execute the SQL statements.
