/* Here is the explanation for the code above:
1. mergeSort() is a recursive function that continuously splits a list in half. If the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case).
If the list has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves.
Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental operation, called a merge, is performed.
Merging is the process of taking two smaller sorted lists and combining them together into a single, sorted, new list.
2. The merge function is used for merging two halves.
Merge(arr, l, m, r) is key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one.
See the following C implementation for details. */
