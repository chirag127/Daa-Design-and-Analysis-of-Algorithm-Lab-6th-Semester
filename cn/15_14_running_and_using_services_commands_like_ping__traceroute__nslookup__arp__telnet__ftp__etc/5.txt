```
This code is like a magic trick. You give it a command and it makes it happen on the computer! 

First, it gets some tools from the library to help it do the trick. 

Then it has a special place called "main" where the magic happens. It has two helpers, "argc" and "argv". 

It makes a box called "command" to store the command you give it. 

It checks if you gave it the right number of helpers, just one command. If not, it tells you how to give the right helpers. 

It puts the command you gave it into the "command" box. 

Then it does the magic by calling the "system" function with the command in the box. 

If the magic didn't work, it tells you there was a problem. 

Finally, it tells you if the magic was a success or not.
