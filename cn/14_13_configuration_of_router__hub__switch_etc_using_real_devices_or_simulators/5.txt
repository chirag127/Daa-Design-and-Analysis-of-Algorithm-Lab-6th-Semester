/*


1. `#include <stdio.h>`: This line helps us use the computer to print things on the screen and read things we type.
2. `#include <string.h>`: This line helps us use the computer to work with words and sentences.
3. `int main()`: This line starts the main part of the program.
4. `char device[10];`: This line makes a place to store a word that we type in later.
5. `printf("Enter the device type (router, hub, switch): ");`: This line asks us to type in a word like "router", "hub", or "switch".
6. `scanf("%s", device);`: This line lets the computer read the word we typed in.
7. `if (strcmp(device, "router") == 0)`: This line checks if the word we typed in is "router".
8. `printf("Configuring router...\n");`: This line tells us the computer is configuring the router.
9. `// code to configure router`: This line is a reminder to add code to configure the router later.
10. `else if (strcmp(device, "hub") == 0)`: This line checks if the word we typed in is "hub".
11. `printf("Configuring hub...\n");`: This line tells us the computer is configuring the hub.
12. `// code to configure hub`: This line is a reminder to add code to configure the hub later.
13. `else if (strcmp(device, "switch") == 0)`: This line checks if the word we typed in is "switch".
14. `printf("Configuring switch...\n");`: This line tells us the computer is configuring the switch.
15. `// code to configure switch`: This line is a reminder to add code to configure the switch later.
16. `else`: This line is executed if the word we typed in is not "router", "hub", or "switch".
17. `printf("Invalid device type\n");`: This line tells us the word we typed in is not correct.
18. `return 0;`: This line ends the program and tells the computer everything went well.
