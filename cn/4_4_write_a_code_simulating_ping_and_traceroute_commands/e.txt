Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```
These are the header files included in the code. They provide various functions and constants that are needed for the code to work. 

```
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
```
This is the main function of the code. The `argc` and `argv` parameters are used to pass command-line arguments to the program.

```
  int sockfd;
  struct sockaddr_in servaddr;
  struct hostent *host;
```
These are the variables declared in the code:
- `sockfd` is a socket file descriptor.
- `servaddr` is a structure that holds the address information of the server.
- `host` is a structure that holds the information about a given host.

```
  if (argc != 2) {
    printf("Usage: %s <IP address>\n", argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }
```
This `if` statement checks if the number of command-line arguments passed to the program is not equal to 2. If it's not equal to 2, it prints a usage message and returns 1.

```
  host = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
  if (host == NULL) {
    printf("Unknown host %s\n", argv[1]);
    return 1;
  }
```
This code uses the `gethostbyname` function to get information about the host specified in the command-line argument. If the host is unknown, it prints an error message and returns 1.

```
  bzero(&servaddr, sizeof(servaddr));
  servaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
  servaddr.sin_addr = *((struct in_addr *)host->h_addr);
  servaddr.sin_port = htons(80);
```
This code initializes the `servaddr` structure with the address information of the server. The `bzero` function is used to clear the structure, and the `sin_family` field is set to `AF_INET` to indicate that the address is an IPv4 address. The `sin_addr` field is set to the address of the host, and the `sin_port` field is set to port 80, which is the standard port for HTTP.

```
  sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMP);
  if (sockfd < 0) {
    perror("socket");
    return 1;
  }
```
This code creates a raw socket using the `socket` function. The `AF_INET` parameter indicates that the socket should be an IPv4 socket, and the `SOCK_RAW` parameter indicates that the socket should be a raw socket. The `IPPROTO_ICMP` parameter indicates that the socket should use the ICMP protocol. If the `socket` function returns a negative value, it means that an error occurred, and the `perror` function is used to print an error message.

```
  // send PING request
  // ...

  // receive PING response
  // ...
```
These are comments indicating the location in the code where the PING request and response should be sent and received, respectively.

```
  close(sockfd);
  return 0;
}
```
This code closes the socket using the `close` function and returns 0 to indicate that the program has completed successfully.
